## My work aims to understand and address water and environmental challenges using multidisciplinary approaches and make cities better places to live.


## Research theme 1: Stormwater management 
- **Description**: Design green infrastructure to mitigate urban flooding and improve water quality.
- **Methods**: Experimental and modeling
- **Link**:[Liao et al. (2024)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.171302); [Liao et al. (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.115506)

## Research theme 2: Plant performance
- **Description**: Engineered biochar amendment to support better plant growth and health in green infrastructure and urban soils.
- **Methods**: Experimental
- **Link**: [Liao et al. (2022)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.152638); [Liao et al. (2019)](http://doi:10.3390/soilsystems3010014); [Tang et al. (2023)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy13051394)

## Research theme 3: Ecosystem functions
- **Description**: Understand overall ecosystem functions of green infrastructure including system erosion, greenhouse gas emissions, and microbial responses.
- **Methods**: Experiment and data science (e.g., meta-analysis)
- **Link**: [Liao et al. (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.3c04185); [Liao et al. (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s42773-022-00186-7)

## Research theme 4: Large-scale monitoring and simulations
- **Description**: Assess and analyze vegetation performance at large scales.
- **Methods**: Remote sensing, GIS, and geospatial analysis
- **Link**: [Liao et al. (in preparation)]; [Karim et al. (2024)](https://doi.org/10.3390/land13101709)
