## About me

I am an NSERC Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Chemical Engineering at McGill University, where my research focuses on nature-based solutions for emerging environmental challenges. I hold a PhD from the Institute of Forestry and Conservation and the Department of Civil & Mineral Engineering at the University of Toronto. Prior to my doctoral studies, I received an Honours Bachelor of Science (HBSc) with High Distinction from the University of Toronto (2015–2019), completing a double major in Forest Conservation and Physical Geography, alongside a minor in Geographic Information Systems (GIS).

​I am currently conducting interdisciplinary research to improve green infrastructure performance at local system scales, including stormwater management (e.g., water treatment), plant performance, and system erosion system monitoring. In addition, I integrate remote sensing, geospatial analysis, and data science approaches to assess green infrastructure performance at regional and global scales. The ultimate goal of my research is to design sustainable, multifunctional green infrastructure that enhances both socioeconomic benefits and environmental resilience. To date, I have received $274,060 in 21 scholarships/awards to support my research. With these supports, I have published 8 scientific manuscripts, including 6 first-author publications, and 1 conference proceedings, and presented my work at 25 academic conferences, 3 industrial companies, and 1 government agency. 

In addition to research,  I am passionate about teaching. I taught a core undergraduate course in Civil Engineering (143 students) independently and field trips in a core undergraduate course as the course instructors in Fall 2022. I have been a teaching assistant in 10 undergraduate and graduate courses since 2019.
​
​Beyond academia, I am a table tennis player (National Grade 2 in China), and I love badminton, skiing, scuba diving, and travel.
